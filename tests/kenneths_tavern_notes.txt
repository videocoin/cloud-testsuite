1) Using $ext in the request body replaces anything else passed in:

  - name: Change password with token from recovery email
    request:
      url: "{environment.host:s}{api_endpoints.recover:s}"
      method: POST
      json:
        # This doesn't work. confirm_password and password will be overridden by 
        # what's returned by utils:get_password_reset_body
        confirm_password: "{environment.test_password_2:s}"
        password: "{environment.test_password_2:s}"
        token:
	        $ext:
	          function: utils:get_password_reset_body
	          extra_kwargs: 
	            pop_server: "{environment.pop_server:s}"
	            test_email: "{environment.test_email:s}"
	            test_email_password: "{environment.test_email_password:s}"
    response:
      status_code: 200

2) Can't save "complex" JSON objects in a file that's !include(d) and compare them to response bodies (https://github.com/taverntesting/tavern/issues/426)

# In test_sign_in.tavern.yaml

test_name: Signing in with incorrect password produces error

stages:
  - name: Sign in with invalid credentials
    request:
      url: "{environment.host:s}{api_endpoints.auth:s}"
      method: POST
      json:
        email: "{environment.test_email:s}"
        password: "{environment.invalid_test_password:s}"
    response:
      status_code: 401
      body: "{error_messages.invalid_credentials}"

# In common.yaml (the included file)

error_messages:
invalid_credentials: 
  fields: null
  message: "Authentication failed"

Another possible hint that this won't work:
"""
The query should be defined as a JMES query (see http://jmespath.org/ for more information). In the above example, this essentially performs the operation json["thing"]["nested"][0]. This can be used to perform powerful queries on response data, but note that only ‘simple’ values like integers, strings, or float values can be saved. Trying to save a ‘block’ of data such as a JSON list or object is currently unsupported and will cause the test to fail.
"""

3) If there's a problem with the an $ext function (like bad Python syntax), it'll show as a   tavern.util.exceptions.BadSchemaError: Couldn't load ext_functions:get_password_reset_body error:

E   tavern.util.exceptions.BadSchemaError: Couldn't load ext_functions:get_password_reset_body
